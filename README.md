 Introduction
Lesson Material used during the [Data Science for the Public Good Program][2]
at the [Social and Decision Analytics Laboratory][1].

> The Data Science for the Public Good program teaches student fellows
> how to sift through vast amounts of information related to public
> safety, employment, and the provision of services to discover how
> communities can become more efficient and sustainable. Through the
> lenses of statistics, social science, and data science research,
> DSPG students will learn to integrate all available data resources

Many of the lessons will be adapted versions of the corresponding
[Software-Carpentry][3] or [Data Carpentry][4] Lesson materials
